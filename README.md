# Kickstarter_Challenge
### Performing analysis to determine any relational trends for outcomes on plays based on their launch date and funding goal. 
## Utilized pivot table and charting to view theater kickstarters by month for successful, failed and canceled funding goals. Analysis was narrowed down to look specifically at plays and a range where their funding dollars amounts fall under. Special attention needed to properly develop COUNTIFS formula for play analysis to ensure all ranges and criteria are properly included. Selected certain analysis results and compared totals to Kickstarter data sheet to ensure data was calculated. Verified the number of canceled plays was zero. 
### Looking at the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date line graph, successful theater had the highest number of successful kickstarters between April and August. Theater kickstarters launched in May had the highest number of successful outcomes. Theater kickstarters launched in December and January had the lowest number of successful outcomes.

### Looking at the Outcomes Based on Goal line graph, successful kickstarters under $5,000 have the highest success rate. Between $10,000 and $20,000 pledged funds, the successful and failed outcomes are similar. After $20,000 the number of successful and failed outcomes has more volatility.

## Based on the analysis above, Louise would be most successful to launch her kickstarter in May and a goal amount under $5,000. However, it is recommended to anaylze the kickstarter to specific country to determine if certain markets perform better than others, as well as reviewing goal outcomes based on year.  The Outcomes Based on Launch Date line graph aggregates by month, however there could have been an upward/downward trend in pledges over the years. The Theater Outcomes Based on the Launch Date line graph can be updated to include only play kickstarters, this will improve the relationship to the Outcomes Based on Goal line graph. The Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date can be adjusted to summarize data based on year in place of month to see if the results are similar year to year. A new Pivot Table can be created to summarize successful theaters/plays based on country and number count based on outcome.
